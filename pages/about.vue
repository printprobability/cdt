      <h5>Why damaged & distinctive types?</h5>
      <br/>
      <p>Recent estimates suggest that the printers of more than half of all books, pamphlets, and broadsides printed in
        Restoration London remain unknown. The CDT is a resource to help identify unknown printers. “Type,” Harry Carter
        once remarked, “is something you can pick up and hold in your hand.” Made of a pliant lead alloy, letterpress
        letters were often damaged during presswork, broken or bent by the heavy action of the press or spoiled by
        debris. Printers kept these disfigured letters in use while damages and idiosyncrasies accrued, providing a
        useful signal for contemporary scholars. Since no two pieces of type will degrade in precisely the same way,
        damaged and distinctive type offers a kind of typographical fingerprint that can reveal the identities of the
        individuals(s) responsible for a book’s making.</p>
      <br/>

      <h5>(Known) Limitations in CDT Data</h5>
      <br/>
      <p>While the CDT is a first-of-its-kind resource for the analysis of distinctive and damaged types at scale, it is
        not comprehensive for its period of coverage (1660-1700). Damaged type data for many printers remains limited
        for a variety of reasons. In many cases, a printer’s output survives only through a handful of editions, some of
        which may survive in only a few copies, few or none of which have been digitized. Moreover, many printers
        undoubtedly owned more fonts than appear here. What’s included in CDT in most cases simply reflects what’s been
        digitized and is publicly available. The CDT is also limited to uppercase, non-ligature characters. Extending
        beyond that set would impair our intention to create a tractable and searchable body of evidence.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Still, the CDT represents a carefully curated set of more than 15,000 characters extracted from digital copies
        of more than 1900 editions printed between 1660 and 1700.</p>
      <br/>

      <h5>A Note on Printers</h5>
      <br/>
      <p>Some Restoration printers worked exclusively in collaboration with a second printer. The respective types of
        these printers — if they had separate type cases at all — are impossible to reliably assign or differentiate. In
        these cases, the names of both collaborators are given as a single entry in the CDT. An index of printers
        included in the CDT is linked
        <NuxtLink target="_blank" :to="{ src: person, name: 'printers' }" aria-label="To printers">here</NuxtLink>
        .
      </p>
      <br/>

      <h5>Print &amp; Probability</h5>
      <br/>
      <p>The type impressions gathered on the CDT were identified using machine learning and computer vision tools
        developed by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="Print & Probability project"
                            href="https://printprobability.org/">Print & Probability</a> project — an interdisciplinary
        of literary historians, bibliographers, librarians, and computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and
        the University of California, San Diego.</p>
      <br/>
